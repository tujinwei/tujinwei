- 👋 Hi there, this is Davi Jinwei.
- 👀 I’m enthusiastic about data analysis and AI use cases, such as scaled learning on images and credit scores.
- 🌱 I’ve learnt matlab, java and R, recently palying with Python.
- 💞️ WHAT would I be after the next five year? -- Probably a bit uglier, probably poorer, but no doubt it is still me:). 
- 📫 How to reach me:  david.jw.tu@gmail.com.
