- 👋 Hi there, this is Davi Jinwei, master student in Business Informatics at TUM.
- 👀 I’m enthusiastic about data analysis and AI use cases, especially in time series and risk management.
- 🌱 I’ve learnt matlab, java and R, recently palying with Python.
- 💞️ WHAT would I be after the next five year? -- Probably a bit better looking, probably a bit uglier, but no doubt it is a real me but not me from another universe. You asked: How do I know? Because I must still remember my AppleID password! 
- 📫 How to reach me:  david.jw.tu@gmail.com.
