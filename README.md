- :smile Hi there, this is Jinwei (David). I am a Chinese master student in Business Informatics at Technical University of Munich (🥮 + 🥨).
- 🔥 I’m enthusiastic about data analysis and AI use cases, especially in time series and risk management. 
- 🚀 MATLAB, JAVA, R, Python. ML project experience with Python. See my [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/jinweitu).
- 🧔 What would I be in five year? -- Probably a bit better looking, probably a bit uglier, but no doubt it is a real me but not me from another universe. You asked: How do I know? Because I must still remember my AppleID password! 
- 👨‍🚀 How to reach me:  david.jw.tu@gmail.com.
